This is a collection of exercises I made while learning Python.

I used courses from:
  * [Pyladies.cz](https://naucse.python.cz/course/pyladies/)
  * [The Python Mega Course 2022: BUild 10 Real-World Programs](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/learn/lecture/29491114#questions)
  * [Head First Learn how to code, Eric Freeman](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-learn/9781491958858/)
